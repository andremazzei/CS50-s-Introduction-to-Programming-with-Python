"""
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels,
much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts
the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
