'''
FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large
letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be
-f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the
name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
